As users started having problems with WhatsApp initialisation...one user on XDA provided a solution that seems to work so far:

1st:
I disabled all permissions from WA before I started the initialization process. Only synchronisation with the contacts won't work.

2nd:
Set back all permissions for WA.

3rd:
To synchronize the contacts go to settings > accounts > WA > WA again > menu > delete account.

4th:
Go back to WA and sync your contacts. Now it should be show them.

For everybody having similar problems with Hike Messenger:

1. Please visit the Hike Messenger beta community on G+ and follow the steps posted here:

2. After following the steps there, you will be included in the beta program and shortly afterwards an update is available on the Play Store for Hike.

3. Update Hike and the initialization should work fine.

This is not a bug in the ROM!
